# Threejs Sandbox

This is a sandbox app I created to be able to play around with three-js.

## Setup

First, install dependencies

`yarn` or `npm i`

Then either:
1. Use `http-server` to serve the assets
2. Use `gulp` if you also want live-reload

**Option 1**

`gulp build`

`yarn global add http-server`

`http-server`

**Option 2**

`gulp`
